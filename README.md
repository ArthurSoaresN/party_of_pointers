# 🧠 Pointer Party in C

A fun and educational project demonstrating various uses of pointers in the C programming language.

This project includes:
- Simple pointers
- Pointers to strings
- Pointers to structs
- Function pointers
- Pointers to pointers
- Function pointer arrays
- Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and memory management with `free`

I made this code in order to better understand how pointers work in C language, 
I accessed this content through the 'Dionisio' channel, his videos have made me 
interested in studying this language more.

## 🚀 Features

- Demonstrates modifying variables through pointers
- Handles dynamic strings and struct fields
- Shows how to call functions through function pointers
- Uses pointer-to-pointer to handle arrays of strings
- Demonstrates safe memory management practices

## 🛠️ Code Structure

- `Person` struct with `name` and `age`
- Arithmetic operations: `add`, `sub`, `mult`, `division`
- `insert_names()` dynamically allocates and initializes an array of strings
- Main function showcases each pointer concept with output
